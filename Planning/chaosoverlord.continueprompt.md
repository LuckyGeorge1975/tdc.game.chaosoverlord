# Chaos Overlords – Session Continuation Prompt

## TL;DR
- Turn dashboard refactored into modular sections powered by an in-memory message hub.
- Finance preview (city + sector) is live via `IFinancePreviewService`; command timeline panel updates reactively.
- Sector tiles now source income/tolerance directly from `SiteData`, surface site names in-map, and expose rich tooltips; Phase 2 Task 14 is complete, so the happy-path backlog is closed.

## What We Just Finished
- Added `IMessageHub`/`MessageHub` in Core and wired it through the App layer to keep the new section view models (turn management, timeline, finance, recruitment, command queue, events) in sync without tight coupling.
- Implemented `FinancePreviewService` plus supporting domain models to surface deterministic projections; TurnViewModel now shares observable collections with a dedicated Finance preview section.
- Command timeline panel now consumes `CommandTimelineUpdatedMessage` snapshots, highlighting active/completed states for the Command sub-phases.
- Reworked sector handling: every sector is instantiated with deterministic `SiteData`, map tiles show site names inline, and hover tooltips list all non-zero modifiers alongside ownership/chaos context. Economy/finance services read the site-driven income/tolerance values.
- Updated planning docs (`architecture`, `tasks`, `progress`, `phases`, `notes`) to reflect the modular UI, finance work, and completion of Task 14.

## Current State & Open Threads
1. **Chaos Payout Placeholder**
   - Finance preview currently exposes a deterministic "Chaos (Estimate)" column sourced from `Sector.ProjectedChaos`; actual payouts/crackdown hooks remain future work (Phase 3/5), but keep the placeholder accurate as the command resolver evolves.
2. **Command Queue Polish**
   - With the message hub in place, evaluate whether additional timeline states or user feedback is needed when commands execute (e.g., highlight failures, integrate event log summaries).
3. **Testing Footprint**
   - TurnViewModel unit tests cover the finance/timeline wiring via stub services. Consider adding integration-level coverage once Task 14 adjusts sector economics.

## Suggested Next Steps for the Incoming Agent
1. Flesh out chaos payout & crackdown hooks (Phase 3 scope) while keeping current projections deterministic.
2. Explore additional feedback in the command timeline/event log linkage, especially for failed actions or multi-gang conflicts.
3. Expand testing coverage (integration or snapshot-style) now that sector/tooltips, finance preview, and command queue are all live.

## Validation / Build Status
- `dotnet test` passes on `P2_HappyPath` after site-driven sector refactor and tooltip/UI updates (2025-10-01).

## Reference Docs
- `Planning/chaosoverlord.architecture.md` – captures messaging hub + finance preview details.
- `Planning/chaosoverlord.progress.md` – now includes Task 14 completion.
- `Planning/chaosoverlord.notes.md` – logs decisions from the modular UI, finance preview, and sector/site refactor.
- `Planning/chaosoverlord.tasks.md` – Phase 2 backlog closed; ready to pivot toward Phase 3 items.

Good luck! Keep the turn loop deterministic and the UI bindings clean.
