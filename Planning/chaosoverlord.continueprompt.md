# Chaos Overlords – Session Continuation Prompt

## TL;DR
- Turn dashboard refactored into modular sections powered by an in-memory message hub.
- Finance preview (city + sector) is live via `IFinancePreviewService`; command timeline panel updates reactively.
- Phase 2 happy-path tasks 7–13 are complete; Task 14 (sector classes/tolerance) remains the last open item before Phase 2 closure.

## What We Just Finished
- Added `IMessageHub`/`MessageHub` in Core and wired it through the App layer to keep the new section view models (turn management, timeline, finance, recruitment, command queue, events) in sync without tight coupling.
- Implemented `FinancePreviewService` plus supporting domain models to surface deterministic projections; TurnViewModel now shares observable collections with a dedicated Finance preview section.
- Command timeline panel now consumes `CommandTimelineUpdatedMessage` snapshots, highlighting active/completed states for the Command sub-phases.
- Updated planning docs (`architecture`, `tasks`, `progress`, `phases`, `notes`) to reflect the modular UI and finance work.

## Current State & Open Threads
1. **Phase 2 Task 14 – Sector Klassen & Basistoleranz**
   - Add sector class metadata (Lower/Middle/Upper) and base tolerance/income configuration.
   - Surface the values in the map UI and flow them into economy/finance previews.
2. **Chaos Payout Placeholder**
   - Finance preview currently exposes a deterministic "Chaos (Estimate)" column sourced from `Sector.ProjectedChaos`; actual payouts/crackdown hooks remain future work (Phase 3/5), but keep the placeholder accurate as the command resolver evolves.
3. **Command Queue Polish**
   - With the message hub in place, evaluate whether additional timeline states or user feedback is needed when commands execute (e.g., highlight failures, integrate event log summaries).
4. **Testing Footprint**
   - TurnViewModel unit tests cover the finance/timeline wiring via stub services. Consider adding integration-level coverage once Task 14 adjusts sector economics.

## Suggested Next Steps for the Incoming Agent
1. Implement Task 14 (sector classes & base tolerance):
   - Extend data models/JSON if needed; update `Sector`/`SectorState` and ensure Economy/Finance preview picks up baseline modifiers.
   - Update map and finance UI to display the class metadata.
   - Write/extend unit tests for the new economic inputs.
2. Re-run `dotnet test` after the sector changes to confirm the new finance calculations are deterministic.
3. Capture the results (screenshots or logs) and update `chaosoverlord.progress.md` once Task 14 lands; prepare to mark Phase 2 as complete.

## Validation / Build Status
- No code changes this session (documentation + planning updates only); `dotnet test` not re-run. Last successful run was during the previous implementation of the finance preview/timeline features.

## Reference Docs
- `Planning/chaosoverlord.architecture.md` – updated with messaging hub + finance preview details.
- `Planning/chaosoverlord.progress.md` – reflects completed Phase 2 tasks 7–13.
- `Planning/chaosoverlord.notes.md` – logs decisions from the modular UI refactor and finance preview service.
- `Planning/chaosoverlord.tasks.md` – status of outstanding work (Task 14 still open).

Good luck! Keep the turn loop deterministic and the UI bindings clean.
