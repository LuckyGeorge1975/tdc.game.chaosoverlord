# Chaos Overlords – Session Continuation Prompt

## TL;DR
- Turn dashboard refactored into modular sections powered by an in-memory message hub.
- Finance preview (city + sector) is live via `IFinancePreviewService`; command timeline panel updates reactively.
- Sector tiles now source income/tolerance directly from `SiteData`, surface site names in-map, and expose rich tooltips; Phase 2 Task 14 is complete, so the happy-path backlog is closed.

## What We Just Finished
- Added `IMessageHub`/`MessageHub` in Core and wired it through the App layer to keep the new section view models (turn management, timeline, finance, recruitment, command queue, events) in sync without tight coupling.
- Implemented `FinancePreviewService` plus supporting domain models to surface deterministic projections; TurnViewModel now shares observable collections with a dedicated Finance preview section.
- Command timeline panel now consumes `CommandTimelineUpdatedMessage` snapshots, highlighting active/completed states for the Command sub-phases.
- Reworked sector handling: every sector is instantiated with deterministic `SiteData`, map tiles show site names inline, and hover tooltips list all non-zero modifiers alongside ownership/chaos context. Economy/finance services read the site-driven income/tolerance values.
- Updated planning docs (`architecture`, `tasks`, `progress`, `phases`, `notes`) to reflect the modular UI, finance work, and completion of Task 14.

## Current State & Open Threads
1. **Chaos Payout Placeholder**
   - Finance preview currently exposes a deterministic "Chaos (Estimate)" column sourced from `Sector.ProjectedChaos`; real payouts/crackdown hooks migrate into Phase 3 (Tasks 17 & 19) and Phase 5.
2. **Command Queue Polish**
   - With the message hub in place, evaluate whether additional timeline states or user feedback is needed when commands execute (e.g., highlight failures, integrate event log summaries). Tie enhancements into Task 19.
3. **Action Framework Design**
   - Before implementing individual core actions, align on shared `ActionContext`, dice helpers, and logging contracts (Task 15). Decisions here affect all downstream mechanics.

## Suggested Next Steps for the Incoming Agent
1. Kick off Task 15: prototype the action/dice framework, including deterministic logging and unit tests.
2. Draft UX updates for Movement/Influence commands (Tasks 16–17) ensuring timeline/map affordances are identified early.
3. Outline additional integration tests or smoke flows covering the forthcoming action loop (Task 19) so they can be implemented alongside features.

## Validation / Build Status
- `dotnet test` passes on `P2_HappyPath` after site-driven sector refactor and tooltip/UI updates (2025-10-01).

## Reference Docs
- `Planning/chaosoverlord.architecture.md` – captures messaging hub + finance preview details.
- `Planning/chaosoverlord.progress.md` – now includes Task 14 completion.
- `Planning/chaosoverlord.notes.md` – logs decisions from the modular UI, finance preview, and sector/site refactor.
- `Planning/chaosoverlord.tasks.md` – Phase 2 backlog closed; ready to pivot toward Phase 3 items.

Good luck! Keep the turn loop deterministic and the UI bindings clean.
